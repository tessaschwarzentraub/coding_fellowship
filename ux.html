            <p style="font-size: small; line-height: 20px; opacity: 60%;">DISCLAIMER: please take this with a grain of salt [or grand assualt as I used to say before someone brought my incorrect use of the idiom to my attention]...anyway I simply looked into articles about what employers really look for/ what people honestly don't want to see on a portfolio site to answer some of my questions about user's interests.</p>
            <h2>Who are they?</h2>
            <p style="opacity: 60%;">Potential employers/ recruiters/ fellow designers</p>
            <h2>What are they looking for?</h2>

                    <p style="line-height: 40px; text-align: left; opacity: 60%;">Derren is a recruiter for a small marketing firm out of Pittsburgh and lives with his girlfriend and two cats. He is looking to expand his company's Research and Development department with new talent in hopes of increasing customer retention and reduce development time. This isn't Derren's only project right now, so he gets easily frusturated when websites have a slow download time along with poor communication throughout the site. If he can't get a feel about the author of the website or get in touch easily, he moves onto the next candidate. </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 40px; text-align: left; opacity: 60%;">Annie is currently a flight attendant interested in making a career change- all of the travel is starting to lose it's appeal, and she would love to find a job that allows her to work from home. Annie has always had a passion for design, so she has decided to jump into building her own portfolio and is seeking out ideas from other peers. She immediatley clicks out of websites that aren't aesthetically pleasing and are difficult to navigate. While her goal is to get inspiration, she would also love to start building relationships within the design community.</p>

        <div class="designChanges"><ui>
            <li>Lower opacity of picture of landing page and lay words over --> gives users more information right away</li><br>
            <li>Brought many problems within my site to light, i.e. scenario mapping showed me that some of my links were incorrect</li><br>
            <li>Added contact button to page at the beginning of site/ created new contact page altogether because it might be the goal of some of my users, but was not easily accesible before</li><br>       
            <li>Added title to further explain my web development/ web design/ user experience buttons</li><br>
            <li>Rearranged order of my sections on landing page for better flow and order</li><br>

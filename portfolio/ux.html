        <p>Although my method was a little scattered, the small amount of time that I took to focus on user experience brought many changes to my site. <a href="#designChanges" class="moreInfoLink">Click here to read more!</a></p>

            <h2>Step 1:<b> User Research</b></h2>
            <p style="font-size: small; line-height: 20px;">DISCLAIMER: please take this with a grain of salt [or grand assualt as I used to say before someone brought my incorrect use of the idiom to my attention]...anyway I simply looked into articles about what employers really look for/ what people honestly don't want to see on a portfolio site to answer some of my questions about user's interests.</p>
            <h2>Who are they?</h2>
            <p>Potential employers/ recruiters/ fellow designers</p>
            <h2>What are they looking for?</h2>
            <p>What I specialize in, my skills, inspiration, how to contact me</p>
            <h2>What are their expectations?</h2>

                    <h3>Derren Olsen</h3>
                    <h3>36 · Pittsburgh, PA</h3>
                    <p style="line-height: 30px; text-align: left;">Derren is a recruiter for a small marketing firm out of Pittsburgh and lives with his girlfriend and two cats. He is looking to expand his company's Research and Development department with new talent in hopes of increasing customer retention and reduce development time. This isn't Derren's only project right now, so he gets easily frusturated when websites have a slow download time along with poor communication throughout the site. If he can't get a feel about the author of the website or get in touch easily, he moves onto the next candidate. </p>

                    <h3>Annie Walters</h3>
                    <h3>38 · Des Moines, IA</h3>
                    <p style="line-height: 30px; text-align: left;">Annie is currently a flight attendant interested in making a career change- all of the travel is starting to lose it's appeal, and she would love to find a job that allows her to work from home. Annie has always had a passion for design, so she has decided to jump into building her own portfolio and is seeking out ideas from other peers. She immediatley clicks out of websites that aren't aesthetically pleasing and are difficult to navigate. While her goal is to get inspiration, she would also love to start building relationships within the design community.</p>
